1. Approach to Analyzing Insider Threats in a Financial Institution
To detect potential insider threats, I would take a systematic, multi-layered approach to analyzing the diverse data sources while balancing security and privacy concerns.

Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
Network Logs: Analyze unusual data transfers, login attempts, and access to restricted systems.
Employee Access Records: Detect anomalies in system access outside of normal working hours or unauthorized attempts.
Email Communications: Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) to flag sensitive keywords related to fraud, data exfiltration, or internal complaints.
Step 2: Feature Engineering & Anomaly Detection
Behavioral Profiling: Establish normal baselines for each employeeâ€™s activities.
Unsupervised Learning: Use clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) to detect deviations.
Graph Analysis: Identify hidden relationships between employees and sensitive data.
Time-Series Analysis: Detect abnormal spikes in access patterns.
Step 3: Addressing Privacy & Ethical Considerations
Data Minimization: Analyze only metadata rather than full content where possible.
Access Control: Restrict investigation data to authorized cybersecurity personnel.
Transparency: Inform employees about monitoring policies to maintain trust.
Step 4: Communicating Findings
Technical Teams: Provide dashboards with detailed logs and anomaly scores.
Non-Technical Stakeholders: Present risk-based summaries with visualizations.
